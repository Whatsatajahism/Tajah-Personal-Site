        <h2>Who even are you?</h2>
        <p id="user-greeting">
          Hi, <span id="user-name">User</span>! You might have already guessed,
          but I'm Tajah, and my pronouns are They/Them. I have spent my entire
          career working with people. First, as an EFL teacher in Spain (shout
          out to Santiago de Compostela and Sevilla, you were great cities to
          live in!), then in an LGBTQ+ charity in London, where I felt my
          identity was getting too tied up in my day job, and most recently in a
          university working in racial equality, where the same thing happened
          again. I found that I liked education more than I liked working for an
          educational institution. I love people, but I don't want to make
          upskilling them my career. And so, I started to learn how to code, to
          give myself more career options, which brought me to my current
          Software Development Appreniceship at Mony Group.

        <h2>Is this where you tell us why you'd be an asset to any team?</h2>
        <p id="second-para">
          Yes dear <span id="user-name">reader</span>, it is. I've been lucky
          enough to work in multiple sectors, with international colleagues. I
          know how to adapt my communication style, look at things from
          different perspectives, and how to hold and sustain a conversation. I
          am determined, from my career-switch journey to the intensity with
          which I approach coding problems to find solutions for our end-users.
          I am also adaptable and creative, which in a coding context means as
          much as I follow designs, I am also able to create reusable, elegant
          solutions to problems. This isn't to say I don't have more to learn
          though! I really enjoy learning from senior developers, and am excited
          to see what new parts of myself I uncover in the process.

      <div class="item fundamental">
        <h2>Learning is what? FUNDAMENTAL!</h2>
        <p>
          I really do love learning, and so I want to showcase the amount of
          hours that have gone into the projects I've made. Hopefully, it will
          also show you my progress with software development. Click on the
          buttons above to see other things I've created. Enjoy judging me! And
          after you're done judging me, I implore you to ask yourselves - what
          have you learnt lately? What has been bringing you joy or aggravation?
          How are you bending your mind towards expansion and allowing the child
          in you to experiment? All this to say, we were all learners once, and
          I hope you keep that in mind while flicking through.

      <div class="item interests">
        <h2>Interests beyond coding</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond coding, I'm a red belt in Taekwondo, which is a Korean martial
          art. I've found it to be an invaluable way to align my bodymind in a
          very mentally unhealthy world. I also taught myself how to use
          nunchuks (for tricks rather than battle), and love cooking up new
          recipes! Finally, I'm plucking up the courage to again call myself a
          writer, most recently graduating from the Harper Collins Author
          Academy Autumn 2023 cohort. You'll see a bit of my writing in my FAC
          game! I'm very much a jack of all trades, master of none, but it does
          mean that I usually have lots of random bits of trivia up my sleeve
          for any occasion! I just really like trying new things, and hope it's
          a quality I never lose to the capitalist machine.

        <p>
          Coding takes a lot of mental concentration for me, not too dissimilar
          to what I need to keep this nunchuk spinning without hurting myself!

          Thanks for taking the time to read my peronal website. I'm more of a

          want to meet me in person!
